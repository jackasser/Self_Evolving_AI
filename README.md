## 🌟 Vision

Imagine an AI that doesn't just follow instructions but _improves itself_ over time. An AI that sets its own learning goals, evaluates its performance, and actively grows its knowledge base. That's Self-Evolving AI—a pioneering project pushing the boundaries of autonomous artificial intelligence.

This isn't just another chatbot or assistant; it's an experimental framework designed to explore how AI systems might develop genuine self-improvement capabilities. We're exploring uncharted territories in AI autonomy, self-reflection, and continuous evolution.

## ✨ Features

- **🧿 Autonomous Learning** - Sets its own learning goals based on interactions and self-assessment
- **🔄 Evolution Cycles** - Periodically runs self-improvement routines to enhance performance
- **📚 Knowledge Expansion** - Autonomously builds and organizes its knowledge base
- **🛡️ Self-Preservation** - Monitors system health and maintains stability
- **⚙️ Process Optimization** - Identifies and eliminates inefficiencies in its own operation
- **📊 Resource Management** - Intelligently allocates computational resources

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-evolving-ai.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd self-evolving-ai

# Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the system
python run_self_evolving_ai.py
```

## 🔍 How It Works

Self-Evolving AI operates through a cyclic process of evaluation, goal-setting, optimization, and knowledge expansion:

```

└─────────────────┘                               │                 │
                                                  └─────────────────┘
```

When you interact with the system, you're not just using a static program—you're participating in its evolution. Each interaction influences its learning trajectory, and every evolution cycle potentially improves its capabilities.

## 🔮 Example Interaction

```
You > What can you tell me about quantum computing?

AI > Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical 
    phenomena like superposition and entanglement to perform computations. 
    Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers 
    use quantum bits or "qubits" that can exist in multiple states simultaneously...

    [After internal processing]
    
    I've identified quantum computing as an area where I should expand my knowledge. 
    Setting a new learning goal: "Deepen understanding of quantum algorithms and 
    their practical applications."
